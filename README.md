## Project Overview
Living in a rapidly changing era, the needs and wants of humans are becoming complicated.  
But, are these necessities of human beings are addressed equally?  
While one have excess resources another one, sometimes the neighbour of the first, needing the same material is ignored. Most of the time, a person who has excess resources does not know a one living close to himself need the same and viceversa.  
Project ESG attempt to gather all these requests based on peoples' geographical location.  
A person who have the excess resources can post about the availability of the resource while a person who need it can claim it through the platform. To minimize travelling charges and to increase the convienice of collecting the resource, we suggest placing the resource in the regioanl village office (Grama Niladhari Office). The admins (Preferrably the Grama Niladhari) of the system should closely monitor the status of trnasactions placed in his/ her office and update the system accordingly.
