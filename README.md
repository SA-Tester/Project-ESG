## Project Description
**First Year - 2nd Semester Mini Project**  
Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology  
Faculty of Applied Sciences  
Uva Wellassa Universty  
Badulla, Sri Lanka  

## Project Overview
Living in a rapidly changing era needs and wants of humans are becoming complicated.  
But, are these necessities of human beings addressed equally?  
While one has excess resources another, who could be the neighbour of the first, needing the same material is ignored. Most of the time, a person having excess resources does not know a one living close to himself needs the same and vice versa.  
<br>
Project ESG attempt to gather all these requests based on peoples' geographical location.  
A person having excess resources can post about the availability of the resource while a person who needs it can claim it through the platform. To minimize travelling charges and to increase the convenience of collecting the resource, we suggest placing the resource in the regional village office (Grama Niladhari Office). The admins (Preferably the Grama Niladhari) of the system should closely monitor the status of transactions placed in their offices and update the system accordingly.  
<br>
NOTE: Transferring resources between the users is not handled by the system. It is done manually and Regional Village Officer should confirm whether the transfer was successful and update the system.
